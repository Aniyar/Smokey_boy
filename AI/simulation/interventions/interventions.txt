2. Plane retardant inherits the fire line with decreased fuel

 a) Manual fire line => Slower but less effective than budlozzers
 b) Bulldozers => Faster and most effective
 c) Plane retardant => Fastes but least effective
2. Any intervention class should use resources
    a) Fire lines:
        i. Manual fire line => Fire fighters
        ii. Buldozzers => Fire fighters, buldozzers
        iii. Plane retardant => Fire fighters, Planes, Ratardant
