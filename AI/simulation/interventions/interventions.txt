1. Fire fighters => Resources
2. Plane retardant inherits the fire line with decreased fuel
3. Helicopter inherits water splash
4. Hydrant is water splash
5. Water is a resource
6. Bulldozer inherits fire lines and draws them faster

1. [Base Class] Modify the fire line class (Speed, Effecivness, Resources subtraction) to inherit from other classes:
 Sub classes:
 a) Manual fire line => Slower but less effective than budlozzers | speed depends on the people amount
 b) Bulldozers => Faster and most effective | speed depends on buldozzers amount
 c) Plane retardant => Fastes but least effective

[DONE]
2. [Base Class] Modify the water splash class (effecitveness, Resources subtraction) to inherit from other classes:
Sub classes:
    b) Manual water splash => Slowest but most effective | speed depends on people amount
    a) Fire engine => Faster but less effecitve | speed depends on fire engines amount #remaining water amount
    b) Helicopters => Fastes but least effective

3. How to do the speed, effecitveness and resources subtraction
    - the main class will know which sub class called it and:
    1. Speed[update i more than one time with each call]
    2. Effecivness[then modify the probability modifier]
    3. Resources[passed from the sub class]

4. Any intervention class should use resources
    a) Fire lines:
        i. Manual fire line => Fire fighters
        ii. Buldozzers => Fire fighters, buldozzers
        iii. Fire plane => Fire fighters, Planes, Ratardant
    b) Water splashers:
        i. Manual splasher => Fire fighters, Water
        ii. Fire engine => Fire fighters, Water, fire engines
        iii. Helicopters => Fire fighters, Water, helicopters

5. Inhericance
    a) Base classes inherits from interventions
    b) Sub classes inherits from base classes

#TO-Do for future
- Gassoline
- Fire fighters specialization
